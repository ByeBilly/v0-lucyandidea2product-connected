## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

### Week 1-2: Low Engagement
**Signals:**

- Low social engagement
- High bounce rate (>70%)

**Actions:**

2. A/B test homepage messaging
3. Try different distribution channels

### Week 2-4: Sign-ups Plateau
**Signals:**
- Growth flattens
- Repeat content gets no traction
- Competitors get more attention

**Actions:**
1. **Don't panic** - this is normal
2. Refresh content angles
3. Try paid marketing (small budget)
4. Consider pivot if signals are weak

### Critical Decision Point (Day 30)

**If you have 500+ signups:**
✅ Strong signal - build the MVP
✅ Users want this
✅ Proceed to launch

**If you have 100-500 signups:**
⚠️ Moderate interest - dig deeper
- Survey signups: Would you pay?
- Analyze drop-off points
- Consider messaging changes

**If you have <100 signups:**
🛑 Weak signal - reassess
- Is this the right audience?
- Is the problem real enough?
